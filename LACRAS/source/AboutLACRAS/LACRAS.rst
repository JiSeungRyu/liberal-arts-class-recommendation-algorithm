Naming and Branding of The Proposed Project
*******************************************

The LACRAS is a system that recommends the liberal arts class for university students.

Based on the "subject similarity algorithm" developed by Sejong University and the "cooperative filtering algorithm" famous for Netflix's movie recommendation algorithm, it was developed as a model for recommending three liberal arts subjects by setting various hyperparameters to increase the performance and satisfaction of recommendations.

We welcome your contributions. LACRAS is the open source project. Everything, from this website to the core of the database itself, has been contributed by helpful individuals. The time and attention of our contributors is our most precious resource, and we always need more of it. Our primary goal is to build a welcoming, supporting, inclusive and diverse community. We abide by Code of Conduct and a set of the project by laws. Welcome to the LACRAS.


Promblem Statement
*********************

Senior students know which class is good. However, it is difficult for freshmen to know. In particular, it is difficult to obtain more information due to less communication with senior students due to COVID-19. So we will create a liberal arts recommendation system. The main target is 1st and 2nd graders, and 3rd and 4th graders can use it for graduation requirements.

Mission Statement
*****************

Create a recommended site for Liberal Arts only for Sejong University, which is convenient and accurate. We hope the open source we develop will help freshmen or enrolled students.
